# Quizzer
Javascript and markup for publishing open-ended "How many X can you name?"-style quizzes. [Example](http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/11/quiz-denver-broncos-coaches/).

## How to create a quiz

1. Copy the markup in full-page.html to a new html file.
2. Edit the markup in the places there's an `<!-- EDIT:` in the markup.
3. Upload the quiz.js to a server somewhere, if it's not up there already.
4. Upload the html file to the same directory quiz.js is in.
5. After you know the URL it will be iframe'd in, update the meta canonical value of the html file to point to there.
