# Quizzer
Javascript and markup for publishing open-ended "How many X can you name?"-style quizzes.

## How to create a quiz

1. Copy the markup in markup.html
2. Edit the markup in the places there's an `<!-- EDIT:` in the markup.
3. Upload the quiz.js to a server somewhere, if it's not up there already.
4. Put this up somewhere online.
